### Hi there 🚀

👋 I'm a software engineer and business owner continuing to learn and build creative solutions. I'm motivated by the tangible change I can make in users' lives.

🦾 I'm joining Roblox's accessibility team this summer with a mission to empower everyone to express themselves and have fun on Roblox.

⌨️ I also run a niche wireless DIY keyboard brand, Nice Keyboards, as well as its retail brand, Typeractive.xyz, in my free time. We create premium products with a polished experience from ordering to delivery to assembly.
